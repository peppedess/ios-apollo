## 1151-apollo-wmi-idle-probe.patch

Three things, after k13c showed the minimal resource config (1 vdev, 4 peers, 8 tids) asserting exactly like
the full one — `cmnos_thread.c`, `Asserted in:0x1503340:0x1530258, line#502` — which rules the config out.

* `sweetwmiidle=<seconds>`: sit still after the service-ready events instead of sending INIT, polling the
  event rings. If SYS_ERR arrives anyway, INIT is not the trigger and the firmware is missing something the
  host owes it (the HAL data-path rings that `ath11k_dp_alloc` and `ath11k_dp_pdev_reo_setup` build before
  `ath11k_wmi_cmd_init`). If it survives, INIT is the trigger.
* `flags2` was off by one: the word index in `wmi_resource_config` is 68, not 67, so
  `CALC_NEXT_DTIM_COUNT_SET` was landing in `msdu_flow_override_config1`.
* HTC header: `NEED_CREDIT_UPDATE` on the credit-controlled WMI endpoint and the per-endpoint sequence
  number in the second word, as `ath11k_htc_prepare_tx_skb` writes them.
* The crash record is now dumped as words around the `Asserted in:` string, not only as text.
